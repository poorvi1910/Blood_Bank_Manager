# Blood_Bank_Manager

Blood banks and healthcare organizations face significant challenges in managing donor data, blood inventory, and recipient requests due to inefficient manual systems. This often results in mismanagement of blood supplies, donor ineligibility, and delays in fulfilling critical blood requests, potentially endangering lives. There is a need for a centralized, automated system to address these gaps and ensure effective management of the blood donation process.

The Blood Donation Database is an efficient and secure system developed to manage the critical processes of blood donation and distribution. It centralizes information about donors, blood inventory, recipients, and donation events, enabling seamless coordination and transparency. The system automates key functions such as donor eligibility tracking, recipient-blood matching, and inventory management, ensuring timely availability of blood supplies. With role-based access control and a user-friendly interface, the database will provide a scalable solution for blood banks, hospitals, and clinics to enhance their operational efficiency and save lives.
